## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Privacy First Design

- **Local video-processing intent**: Video processing is designed to happen on your computer; account flows, YouTube uploads, diagnostics/support submissions, and future payment paths may send selected data outside the device.
- **No broad data-collection claim without evidence**: Current privacy claims must be limited to verified flows.
- **No Telemetry**: No analytics or tracking
- **Open Source**: Code is publicly auditable on GitHub

### Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: File operations are sandboxed
- **Secure LCU Communication**: HTTPS with certificate validation
- **No Secrets in Logs**: Sensitive data is redacted from logs
